## Hi there 👋

My name is Daniel Serrano, and I'm a Systems Administrator focused on Linux, virtualization, networking, and cloud — currently aiming to grow in the cybersecurity field.

🔭 I’m currently working at Cadifone as a Networking Technician.

🌱 I’m currently learning CTFS (TryHackMe & Hack The Box ), Python automation, cloud security, and Docker orchestration.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source infrastructure, automation, and cybersecurity projects.
